I wrote this app for myself.

The code is highly adjustable so don't mind using it and bending it to your needs.

Don't mind the sad JSON reader, writer I wrote. It fully rewrites the file content without a proper JSON read and replace instead. 
Done so to save-up time.

1. Run the app.

As easy as that ðŸ˜„.
